Here is a **simple and deeply explained** version of your `README.md`, written for a **non-technical person** to understand what the script does, how to use it, and why it's helpful.

# 🌀 Simple Log Rotation Script – Explained for Everyone

## 🧠 What is this script for?

Imagine you have many log files — like digital diaries that apps write every day.

These log files:

- grow over time,
- can eat up your disk space,
- become hard to manage manually.

This **script helps you automatically clean them up**. It will:

✅ Make a copy of each log file  
✅ Give it a date-based name  
✅ Compress it to save space  
✅ Store it safely in an "archive" folder  
✅ (Optional) Delete really old log backups if you ask it to

---

## 🛠️ What do I need?

You just need a computer that supports Linux and has some basic commands installed like `find`, `awk`, `gzip`, etc. Don’t worry — if any of these are missing, the script will tell you.

---

## 📝 What does it actually do? Step by step

Let’s say your log file is:
```

/var/log/apps/server.log

```

Here’s what happens:

1. It makes a **copy** of that file:
```

server.log.20250627

```

2. It **compresses** the copy into a `.gz` file to save space:
```

server.log.20250627.gz

```

3. It **empties** the original log file (so the app can keep writing into it from scratch).

4. It **moves** the compressed file to a backup folder like:
```

/var/log/apps/old\_logs/20250627/server.log.20250627.gz

````

5. If you asked the script to **delete old backups** (by using `-r` option), it will remove files older than that many days.

---

## 🖥️ How do I use it?

### Basic Use

Run the script like this:

```bash command
./logrotate.sh -D
````

This will rotate the `.log` files in the default folder `/var/log/apps`.

### Full options explained in simple terms:

| Option              | What it means                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-H`                | Use **exact time** in the file name like `20250627T12:30:00`             |
| `-D`                | Use only the **date** like `20250627` (easier to read)                   |
| `-p /my/log/folder` | Use a **different folder** where your logs are stored                    |
| `-f "*.txt"`        | Rotate files ending in `.txt` instead of `.log`                          |
| `-r 7`              | **Delete old backups** that are older than 7 days                        |
| `-n`                | **Test mode** – show what it will do, but **don’t actually do anything** |

---

## 💡 Examples

### 1. Just rotate today’s logs:

```bash command
./logrotate.sh -D
```

### 2. Rotate `.txt` logs in `/tmp/logs`:

```bash command
./logrotate.sh -p /tmp/logs -f "*.txt" -D
```

### 3. Rotate logs and delete backups older than 5 days:

```bash command
./logrotate.sh -r 5 -D
```

### 4. Try it out without touching anything:

 command
./logrotate.sh -n -D
```

## 📂 Where do my old logs go?

They are moved into a folder like this:

```
/var/log/apps/old_logs/20250627/
```

Each log is compressed to save space and renamed to include the date it was rotated.

---

## 🧽 What happens if I don’t use this?

Without log rotation:

* Your disk may fill up.
* Your server might slow down.
* You won’t know which logs are recent or old.
* It’s harder to manage files manually.

This script does the cleaning and organizing for you automatically.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

* **Safe to test**: You can always use `-n` for dry-run.
* **Doesn’t delete logs unless you tell it to**.
* You can schedule this script using cron (automatic scheduling tool) if you want it to run daily.

## 💬 Need help?

If you're unsure where your logs are stored or how to run this, ask your system admin or IT team. Just show them this file — they’ll know what to do.
